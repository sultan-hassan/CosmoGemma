      "1 b'  The IMAGES project aims at measuring the velocity fields of a representative\\nsample of 100 massive galaxies at z=0.4-0.75, selected in the CDFS, the CFRS\\nand the HDFS fields. It uses the world-unique mode of multiple integral field\\nunits of FLAMES/ GIRAFFE at VLT. The resolved-kinematics data allow us to\\nsample the large scale motions at ~ few kpc scale for each galaxy. They have\\nbeen combined with the deepest HST/ACS, Spitzer (MIPS and IRAC) and VLT/FORS2\\never achieved observations. Most intermediate redshift galaxies show anomalous\\nvelocity fields: 6 Gyrs ago, half of the present day spirals were out of\\nequilibrium and had peculiar morphologies. The wealth of the data in these\\nfields allow us to modelize the physical processes in each galaxy with an\\naccuracy almost similar to what is done in the local Universe. These detailed\\nanalyses reveal the importance of merger processes, including their remnant\\nphases. Together with the large evolution of spiral properties, this points out\\nthe importance of disk survival and strengthens the disk rebuilding scenario.\\nThis suggests that the hierarchical scenario may apply to the elaboration of\\ndisk galaxies as it does for ellipticals.\\n'\n",
